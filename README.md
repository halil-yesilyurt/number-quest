A simple number guessing game where users try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 30. Each incorrect guess decreases the score by one point. When the correct number is guessed, the score is saved as the high score if it is higher than the previous high score. The game features a reset functionality, allowing users to play again after each round.
